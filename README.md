# Weather App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

This is a Weather App that shows the current weather details for any location. Right now it shows basic details like Current Temperature, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, etc. But we can expand it to show many more weather details like wind speed, sunset time, sunrise time, etc. We have to get weather data of any location in 3 ways by allowing the location access, By placing markers anywhere on the map, and By searching by name of the city. This is a free app made using OpenWeatherAPI.
